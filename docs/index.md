Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu.  
This is the website for the Coding for Beginners course organized by [ilmHub](https://ilmhub.com/).
Everything you need to know about the course will be posted here.

## About the Course
The course is designed for individuals with no prior experience in coding.
In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of coding through Python.
This is a widely used programming language, and one of the commonly used languages for beginners at universities and other institutions.

By the end of the course, insha Allah, you'll be able to write simple programs independently and will be prepared to pursue more advanced courses or continue learning on your own.
We will intentionally avoid advanced topics to keep the course accessible to beginners.

## Software Requirements
Please install the following software before the first class. 
If you face any issues, we will sort them out in the first class insha Allah.

- **Python**: If you are on Windows or Mac, go to the bottom of the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130/) where the heading says "Files". Download and install the file that says "Windows installer (64-bit)" for Windows or "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer" for Mac.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Download the installer from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install it. This is the code editor we will be using in the course.
