## *Reading* code
Below are some examples of Python code.
What do you think each code does?

### Example 1
```python
1+2
```

### Example 2
```python
sum([1,2,3])
```

### Example 3
```python
a = input("Enter a number: ")
b = input("Enter another number: ")
a+b
```

## Running code online
Ideally, you would run the code on your computer.
But it will require some installation, so let's start by running them online.
Open [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and paste any of the code above on the black box.
